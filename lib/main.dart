  String dummieText = "Sun-drenched Los Cabos is a resort on the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California peninsula. The region has two very different parts: Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo. These two cities are at both ends of the corridor, a 32-kilometer (20-mile) highway surrounded by world-class golf courses and resort hotels. Dance non-stop and go shopping in dynamic Cabo San Lucas, or walk through the old streets of San José del Cabo if you prefer to have a more traditional experience. After having enjoyed the activities on land, also take advantage of those offered by the waters of the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of ​​Cortez, which separates the peninsula from the continent.";
